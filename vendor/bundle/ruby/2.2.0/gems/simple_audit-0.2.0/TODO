# Architecture
* support for ActiveModel
* ORM agnosticism

# Functionality
* configure object used as current user
* fallback to :to_s for username_method
* provide some sort of UUID for audited models that identify these independently from the database provided ID.
  in case of deletion and creation of a new entity with the same UUID, the audit trails of both entities could be bound.
  e.g. for an invoice the UUID could be its number/series combination. when someone deletes an invoice and creates a new one
  with the same UUID, the audit trail of both instances should be bound, such that the deletion event is visible during the audit (i.e. in the view helper)

* recent activity page

# Testing
* test helper  

# Minor
* provide a sample css file for audit trail rendering
